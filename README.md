 # live currency exchange calculator

Hi my name is Snir.
I'm here to explain to you about the project you're about to see.
I built this project to show capabilities used in API calls
The opening page is modified using REACT animation.
It is followed by a running news bar. Which provides news from around the world on any topic.
And below that is the highlight of a live currency exchange calculator.
All currencies are denominated against the US dollar.
Wish you a pleasant use :)
